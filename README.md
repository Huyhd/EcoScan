EcoScan is an award-winning AI-enabled application for nutrition planning.

It can detect various types of foods live using a phone camera. The app was developed by @huydhoang @SharozTariq @SoominKim PhuongYenHoang at Global Hackathon in Jeju. We were awarded Most Outstanding prize.

The code was later cleaned and reorganized by Tam H. Doan.

This is an open source project.
